## Project Description

The **COVID Tweet NLP Analysis** project serves as a university project for text analytics and public opinion analysis. It aims to provide insights into how people feel about COVID-19 through their tweets. By applying machine learning techniques, we classify sentiments and extract topics that are most relevant to the ongoing pandemic.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **NLP Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models.
  - `NLTK` for natural language processing tasks.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Machine Learning Techniques**:
  - TF-IDF for feature extraction.
  - KMeans clustering for topic modeling.
  - Voting Classifiers for sentiment classification.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaoncse/covid-tweet-nlp-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd covid-tweet-nlp-analysis
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   Then install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the project. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the Dataset**: You can find the dataset in the `data` folder or download it from the provided sources.

2. **Run the Analysis Script**:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

3. **View Results**: The results will be saved in the `results` folder. You can visualize the sentiment classification and topic extraction through the generated plots.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/shaoncse/covid-tweet-nlp-analysis/releases) section.

## Data Sources

The data for this project comes from Twitter. We collected tweets related to COVID-19 using the Twitter API. Make sure to follow Twitter's guidelines and API rate limits when collecting data.

## Analysis Techniques

### TF-IDF

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. It helps in identifying the most relevant words in tweets.

### KMeans Clustering

KMeans is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points together. In this project, we use KMeans to cluster tweets into topics based on their content.

### Voting Classifiers

Voting Classifiers combine multiple machine learning models to improve the accuracy of predictions. We utilize this technique to classify sentiments in tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Results

The project generates various outputs, including:

- **Sentiment Analysis Reports**: Summary of sentiments across tweets.
- **Topic Clusters**: Visualization of the main topics discussed in COVID-19 tweets.
- **Graphs and Charts**: Data visualizations that illustrate trends and patterns in public opinion.

You can check the results in the `results` folder after running the analysis script.
